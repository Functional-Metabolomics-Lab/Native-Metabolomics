# Native-Metabolomics-1
Code and Documentation for Native Metabolomics Workflow Mass-Offset Matching
This jumpyter Noteboke allows for mass offset matching between to metabolomics feature tables (matrix with m/z and RT values).
Two features tables files that are supposed te be matched with a defined mass difference (e.g. intact protein mass) need to specified in the notebook along waith mass and RT tolerance.
The output filed contains a merged feature table that lists all redundant matched feature pairs.
